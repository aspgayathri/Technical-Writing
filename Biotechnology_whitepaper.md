### 2.	Biotechnology Breakthroughs in Disease Treatment
The landscape of disease treatment has undergone a profound transformation through biotechnology breakthroughs. These advancements encompass a spectrum of remarkable interventions such as:
- **Gene Editing Technologies**

Gene editing technologies are powerful tools that allow scientists to make precise changes to the DNA within living organisms. These changes can involve adding, removing, or modifying specific parts of the genetic code. Gene editing opens new possibilities for understanding genetics, developing treatments for diseases, and even improving crops and animals.

| Gene Editing Technology | Description | Example Applications |
| ----------------------- | ------------ |--------------------- |
| CRISPR-Cas9 | Uses RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9 to introduce targeted double-strand breaks, leading to gene modifications when repaired | Correcting genetic mutations, creating knockout organisms |
| TALEN (Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases) | Utilizes custom-designed DNA-binding proteins to introduce double-strand breaks | Engineering plant traits, modifying immune cells for therapy |
| ZFNs (Zinc Finger Nucleases) | Uses engineered zinc finger proteins to create targeted DNA breaks | Gene therapy, genome editing in model organisms |
